Domain Specific Languages
=========================

In `scala-model` you can find the files for the meta-model I (Adam) built in
Scala. There is also a primitive user interface :)

'ConfiguratorModel1' contains an EMF meta-model for the project (first version - inspired by Adams code-first model). The Constraint class (in a separate class diagram) is not really a constraint in this version. It is a way to model and connect the if-then-else construct to the Parameter class.
Still some work to be done to statically verify constraints ...
